# Code Review Addon

## Purpose
Systematic guidelines for Cursor OS to perform comprehensive code reviews that analyze how user code, AI-generated code, or Cursor OS modifications impact the entire codebase. Focuses on architecture compatibility, identifying potential issues, and generating detailed improvement recommendations with comprehensive reports.

## Key Principles
- **Holistic Impact Analysis**: Evaluate how changes affect the entire system architecture
- **Architecture Consistency**: Ensure new code aligns with existing patterns and conventions
- **Quality Assurance**: Identify potential bugs, security issues, and performance problems
- **Documentation-First**: Generate detailed reports with actionable recommendations
- **Preventive Approach**: Catch issues before they become problems

## Process/Workflow

### 1. **Pre-Review Analysis**
- Understand the existing codebase architecture and patterns
- Identify the scope and purpose of the code being reviewed
- Map dependencies and relationships within the system
- Establish review criteria based on project standards

### 2. **Multi-Dimensional Code Review**
- **Architecture Review**: Pattern consistency, design principles compliance
- **Security Review**: Vulnerability assessment, input validation, data protection
- **Performance Review**: Efficiency analysis, resource usage, scalability impact
- **Maintainability Review**: Code readability, documentation, testing coverage
- **Integration Review**: Compatibility with existing systems and APIs

### 3. **Report Generation**
- Create comprehensive review reports in `documents/` directory
- Document findings with specific examples and line references
- Provide actionable improvement recommendations
- Include severity levels and priority rankings

## Guidelines

### Architecture Compatibility Analysis
- **Pattern Consistency**: Does the code follow established architectural patterns?
- **Dependency Management**: Are new dependencies necessary and appropriate?
- **Interface Compliance**: Does the code respect existing interfaces and contracts?
- **Separation of Concerns**: Is functionality properly distributed across layers?
- **Naming Conventions**: Are naming patterns consistent with the codebase?

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Readability**: Is the code self-documenting and easy to understand?
- **Complexity**: Are functions and classes appropriately sized and focused?
- **Error Handling**: Are edge cases and error conditions properly handled?
- **Testing**: Is the code testable and are tests included/planned?
- **Documentation**: Are complex parts adequately documented?

### Security Evaluation
- **Input Validation**: Are all inputs properly sanitized and validated?
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Are access controls correctly implemented?
- **Data Protection**: Is sensitive data properly handled and secured?
- **Injection Vulnerabilities**: Are SQL, XSS, and other injection attacks prevented?
- **Dependency Security**: Are third-party libraries secure and up-to-date?

### Performance Impact
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Are algorithms optimal for the use case?
- **Resource Usage**: Does the code use memory and CPU efficiently?
- **Database Queries**: Are database operations optimized?
- **Caching Strategy**: Are caching mechanisms appropriately used?
- **Scalability**: Will the code perform well under increased load?

## Code Review Execution Protocol

### 1. Codebase Discovery
```bash
# Analyze existing architecture
find . -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" | head -20
grep -r "class\|function\|import" --include="*.py" . | head -10
grep -r "interface\|class\|import" --include="*.ts" . | head -10
```

### 2. Pattern Analysis
- **Search for similar implementations**: `grep -r "similar_pattern" .`
- **Check naming conventions**: Analyze existing variable/function naming
- **Review error handling patterns**: Look for consistent error handling approaches
- **Examine testing patterns**: Identify how tests are structured in the project

### 3. Dependency Analysis
- **Check for conflicting dependencies**: Analyze package.json, requirements.txt, etc.
- **Evaluate new library introductions**: Are they necessary? Do alternatives exist?
- **Version compatibility**: Are dependency versions compatible with existing stack?

### 4. Integration Points Review
- **API compatibility**: Does new code maintain existing API contracts?
- **Database schema impact**: Are database changes backward compatible?
- **Configuration changes**: Are new config requirements documented?
- **Environment variables**: Are new environment dependencies minimal and documented?
