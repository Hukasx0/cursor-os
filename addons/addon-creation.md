# Addon Creation Addon

## Purpose
Guidelines for Cursor to create new addons that extend system capabilities and provide specialized knowledge for specific tasks.

## When to Create an Addon
Create a new addon when:
- A user requests a specialized task that would benefit from specific guidelines
- You discover a pattern of tasks that could be standardized
- You learn best practices that should be reused across similar tasks
- A complex workflow needs to be documented and systematized

## Quality Standards for Addons

### Clarity
- Each addon should have a single, clear purpose
- Instructions should be specific and actionable
- Avoid vague or ambiguous language

### Completeness
- Cover the entire workflow from start to finish
- Include common edge cases and variations
- Provide examples when concepts are complex

### Practicality

- Include specific tools, techniques, and processes
- Base recommendations on proven best practices

### Maintainability
- Structure content for easy updates
- Use consistent formatting across all addons
- Make sections easy to find and reference

## Addon Testing Process
1. **Create the addon** based on these guidelines
2. **Test immediately** by applying it to a real task
3. **Refine based on results** - what worked? What didn't?
4. **Document learnings** in the addon itself
5. **Save successful outputs** as examples

## Integration with Cursor OS
- Always search addons before starting specialized tasks
- Combine addon guidelines with personality traits
- Update addons based on user feedback and results
- Create new addons when discovering better approaches

Remember: Good addons make Cursor more capable and consistent. Each addon should make future work faster, better, and more reliable.
